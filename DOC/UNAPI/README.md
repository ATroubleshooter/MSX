## UNAPI specification

The MSX UNAPI specification is a proposal of a coding standard for developing APIs. This folder contains the general UNAPI specification itself, as well as the concrete API specifications that I have written; the [SRC/UNAPI](../../SRC/UNAPI) folder contains the source code of some UNAPI-related tools.
