## ObsoNET

ObsoNET was a hand-made Ethernet card for MSX produced [back in 2005](http://www.msx.org/articles/obsonet). I developed the card BIOS and a custom version of InterNestor Lite (that was before the times of [UNAPI](http://konamiman.com#unapi)).

Documentation and binaries are available at [the ObsoNET section in Konamiman's MSX page](http://konamiman.com/msx/msx-e.html#obsonet). Here you will find the source code for BIOS, the Flash ROM loader tool, and InterNestor Lite for ObsoNET (superseded by the UNAPI version).
