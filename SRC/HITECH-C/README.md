## Hitech C

_Hitech C_ is a C compiler for CP/M (hence it works in MSX-DOS), it is available for download at [Z80.eu](http://www.z80.eu/c-compiler.html). I had a section on my web site with some tools to use with this compiler and miscellaneous C source code, but for some reason that I can't remember I removed it when I redesigned the site back in 2003. Well, here it is all back again.
