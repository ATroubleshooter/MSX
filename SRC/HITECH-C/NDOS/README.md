## NDOS

NDOS is a set of routines to invoke MSX-DOS functions from C code. Unfortunately I lost the English verion of the user manual, so only the Spanish version is available ([NDOS.TXT](NDOS.TXT), the character encoding is CP850, the one used by MSX computers with Spanish keyboard). However since these are mostly just direct translations of the MSX-DOS functions, you can get a grasp of how it works by looking at [the .H file](NDOS.H) and the MSX-DOS documentation itself.

Note that these routines depend on NASM, which is in [the MISC folder](../MISC).
