## InterNestor Suite

InterNestor Suite is the first TCP/IP stack that I developed for MSX. It was my final project when I was studying telecommunications engineering, and as such it is nicely divided in independent layers; but it is heavy (requires a computer with 256K RAM) and not very suited for actual usage. It was rapidly superseded by what was my next project, [InterNestor Lite](../INL).

The complete package with binaries and documentation is available at [Konamiman's MSX Page](http://konamiman.com/msx/msx-e.html#proyectointernestor).
