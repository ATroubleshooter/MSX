## MegaSCSI

MegaSCSI was a SCSI controller for MSX developed by [ESE Artists Factory](http://www.hat.hi-ho.ne.jp/tujikawa/ese) in 1995. Back in its time it was a pretty advanced and awesome piece of hardware.

Here are the sources of some tools that I developed for this device. Unortunately I haven't been able to find the sources of PARSET, the particion changer.

Information and binaries are available at [Konamiman's MSX page](http://konamiman.com#megascsi).
