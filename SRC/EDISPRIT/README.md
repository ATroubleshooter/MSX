## EDISPRIT ##

This is probably the oldest piece of software in this repository, dating back from 1994. It's a sprite editor programmed in XBASIC, with a small assembler routine (of which unfortunately I don't keep the source) for mapped memory mangement.

Run it with `RUN "EDISPRIT.BAS"` from the BASIC prompt. Press SELECT after the program starts if you don't have a mouse; other than that the tool is pretty straightforward to use, but for more details (including the file formats) see EDISPRIT.ENG (or EDISPRIT.ESP in Spanish).

By the way, the "NO TE ATREVAS A VENDERLO, LASP" message translates to "Don't dare to sell it, LASP". LASP was a one-person Spanish company that sold MSX hardware and software, including pirated copies of commercial software and public domain software at high prices.
