## DenyoNet

DenyoNet is an Ethernet cartridge for MSX developed by Dennis Koller and Jos van den Biggelaar, and produced by [Sunrise for MSX](http://www.msx.ch/sunformsx). The nice thing about this carridge is that it handles TCP/IP internally, by using dedicated hardware.

For binaries and documentation, take a look at [Konamiman's MSX page](http://www.konamiman.com#denyonet).
