## Networking Applications

A suite of miscellaneous applications that use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with another machine via Internet or a local network. They will work with any implementation of the [TCP/IP UNAPI specification](http://konamiman.com/msx/msx-e.html#tcpipunapi), for example [InterNestor Lite](../INL).

Binaries, documentation and more resources are available at [Konamiman's MSX page](http://www.konamiman.com#networking).
