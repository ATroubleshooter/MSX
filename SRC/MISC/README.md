## Miscellaneous sources

This is a hodge-podge of source code files with no relation whatsoever between them. It is just a copy of the meaningful files "sources" folder in my MSX storage device. Here you will find from small code snippets to full-fledged applications such as NestorMan.

Most of these files are in Spanish. I have added a small header in English to each file explaining what the code does, but for the rest of the file contents, you are on your own.

For some of the files there are additional resources (documentation, samples) [in my MSX page](http://www.konamiman.com).

Some of this code will build finished applications, some are unfinished work in progress, some will be useful in combination with others. This folder is mainly intended to be browsed in a rainy Sunday afternoon with a soft drink and a bucket of pocorn. If this results in you finding something useful, great! If not, well, I hope you at least had some fun and learned something in the process.

May the Source be with you.
