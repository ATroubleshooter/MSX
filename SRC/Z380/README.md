## LPE-Z380

LPE-Z380 was a card featuring a Z380 processor developed by [Leonardo Padial](http://msx.deneb.nl) in 2000. I developed the BIOS and some tools for this card; here you have the source code of it all.

Information and binaries are available at [Konamiman's MSX page](http://konamiman.com#z380).
